# CS330_Computer-Graphics

In this project, I aimed to replicate various objects from a photograph of a desk within a C++ program using OpenGL. The scene includes a variety of 3D shapes, such as planes for the desk and backdrop, boxes for books and a canvas painting, and torus shapes for a candle jar and headphone elements. Cylinders were utilized for objects like paint tubes, brushes, and cans, while cones were used for the paintbrush bristles and candle flames. Many of these objects required multiple shapes to be combined, such as the candle, which used a torus for the jar, a cylinder for the wax, and additional cylinders and cones for the wicks and flames.

The project also allows the end user to navigate the 3D scene by using mouse and keyboard inputs. The mouse controls the camera direction, while the keyboard keys, with a speed multiplier, allow for smooth movement around the sccene. Additional custom controls, such as spacebar for moving up and left control for moving down, were added to allow for  a more intuitive experience that is similar to controls found in many games.

Texturing played a crucial role in enhancing the realism of the scene, with 20 different textures applied to various objects such as the books, desk, paint tubes, and flames of the candle. Some textures required special adjustments, such as the paint tubes, which needed to be properly aligned across the entire shape. Lighting was carefully crafted to mimic the warm ambiance of the original photo, with a candle providing a warm glow and an overhead lamp offering more even lighting. Shader materials were employed to give objects like the drink can and paint tubes a realistic metallic finish, while the flames used a glass shader to enhance the glowing effect and the wooden desk absorbed and diffused light with a less aggresive reflection.
